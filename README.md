- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) package manager (Recommended)

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), used for building and deployment

- Getting the repository

git clone https://github.com/ragestudio/comty && cd comty
```

- Installing all dependencies
```shell
yarn
```

### Starting the development server
- You can use the command `yarn dev` to start all development servers with the `nodemon` package, which will restart the server when a file is changed.

## Status
This project is in a alpha design phase, there are still many phases to go through.

At the moment the ***development is slow but without pause***, because being a very complicated and important phase, we are **prioritizing quality** so that the project base can be preserved for a **long time**.

Now **we are looking** for a team too.
Anyway, anyone interested, we are **looking for you**. 

***Any contribution is very grateful, we need you more than ever!***
