## Status
This project is in a **very early** design phase, there are still many phases to go through, now **we are looking** for a team to start developing all these factors.
Until we establish this phase, much of the project looks v**ery inconsistent and confusing**.
At the moment the ***development is slow but without pause***, because being a very complicated and important phase, we are **prioritizing quality** so that the project base can be preserved for a **long time**.
As many changes are coming, it is normal for him to change his appearance radically.

Anyway, anyone interested, we are **looking for you**. As at the moment it is very difficult to explain how this works and how this project will be managed, **feel free to contact us.**
***Very soon*** new updates adding much more information about this project.

***Any contribution is very grateful, we need you more than ever!***
